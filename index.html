          <h3 class="post-title">Learning Front End Skills - To Code PAPA</h3>
          <div class="post-content">
            <p>I am working through the getMimo website today in order learn some more about writing HTML5 code. <em>I am working on a blog website.</em> This is actually good content. I am learning quite a bit.</p>
            <p>Plus, I am getting some practice working with Atom. It's good stuff. I will use this code in a larger project, eventually. <strong>That is one thing I am learning about code. It can be saved and reused to save time.</strong> A coder can build on what he has done before and reuse stuff. One of the advantages of <strong>experience</strong>, probably.</p>
            <p>I have been working with jQuery on <a href="https://www.teamtreehouse.com">Treehouse</a> lately. Using a lot of Git and <a href="https://www.github.com">Github</a>. Working on master those workflows as well. It takes many, many hours to become fluent with these skills. This project is more practice. And I am getting more and more comfortable the more I work on these things.</p>
